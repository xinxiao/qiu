I made this game for my laolao(grandma) a while ago.

Back then she was diagnosed with cancer and for most of time she had to stay in the hospital for chemo. This was her favorite game on PC, so I made a web version of it for her to play on a phone or an iPad, which are more accessible in hospitals. She had sufferred a lot from the treatment, but she told me this little game was something that helped her through.

She passed on March 27th, 2021, peacefully and no longer feeling any pain. Because of COVID, I couldn't be there to say goodbye for the last time. I had so many thought in my head, but right now as I'm typing right here, I just don't know what should be put down. 

I hope you will some time play the game again;

And,

姥姥，我很想你 :(
